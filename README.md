# Pandas-tutorial

The most often used open source Python library for data science, data analysis, and machine learning activities is called Pandas. It is constructed on top of Numpy, a different package that supports multi-dimensional arrays. In the Python ecosystem, Pandas is one of the most widely used data wrangling packages. It integrates well with a variety of other data science modules, and it is typically available in all Python distributions, including those sold by commercial vendors like [ActiveState's](https://platform.activestate.com/featured-projects?_ga=2.126977421.1829063026.1668406026-1004339688.1668406026) and those that come with your operating system.
